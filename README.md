# Minesweepers-Competition-2016
Brief Description of the Ain Shams University-Minesweepers Team Project

I worked as a leader for the software team with two other teams (Control & Mechanical) to create a minesweeper car.

Worked with five team members on developing an application using C# programming language to control the robot that uses an Arduino microcontroller.

We also developed another C# application for receiving the coordinates of the robot and the state of the mine (on surface or buried) for each square in the map.


Software: 
C# Programming language, Microsoft visual studio.
